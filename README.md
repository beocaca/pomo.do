# Final Project
This is the repository for the **Harvard's CS50x Final Project** 


### Getting Started
> Creating an entire project may seem daunting. Here are some questions that you should think about as you start:

+ What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
+ What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
+ If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
+ In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so itâ€™s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope. What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome?

Consider making goal milestones to keep you on track.
